# Creation Date File Renamer

Desktop app for renaming files to their creation date.
When transferring photos or videos from mobile devices, often the media files names are something like this:
IMG_1234.jpg

Simply choose the root directory, the file extentions you want to be renamed, and go.
this will rename all files to thier creation date - aka the date the photo or video was shot.
Currently works with this date format: YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.jpg

IMG_1234.JPG -> 2018-10-02_21-00-00.jpg
